Gumucio.com
=========================

This is the rails version of family portal gumucio.com
- Blog like family portal and link collection with tight social network integration.

Design points

  	 - Image - pretty vanilla implementation.
	 - Geni reference, basically a link to a resource on geneology site geni.com
	 - Link URL, it is a link 
- No built in password authentication scheme, all authentication done via twitter/facebook/openID/Google Apps (Google Apps preferred)
- This project is a way to learn rails, but it's not a public repo. Don't clone and publish.
